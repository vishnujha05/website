        <h4>Our History</h4><br>
        <p class=""> Started in 2010, Ristorante con Fusion quickly established itself as a culinary icon par excellence
          in Hong
          Kong. With its unique brand of world fusion cuisine that can be found nowhere else, it enjoys patronage from
          the A-list clientele in Hong Kong. Featuring four of the best three-star Michelin chefs in the world, you
          never know what will arrive on your plate the next time you visit us. <br><br>
          The restaurant traces its humble beginnings to The Frying Pan, a successful chain started by our CEO, Mr.
          Peter Pan, that featured for the first time the world's best cuisines in a pan.</p>

      <h4 class="border-top pt-5 mr-5">Corporate Leadership</h4>
      <h5>Peter Pan <small> Chief Epicurious Officer</small></h5>
      <p class="pr-5 d-none d-sm-block">Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant parents who
        undertook the arduous
        journey to the
        shores of America with the intention of giving their children the best future. His mother's wizardy in the
        kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available inexpensively at the supermarket, was his
        first inspiration to create the fusion cuisines for which The Frying Pan became well known. He brings his zeal
        for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural culinary connections.
      </p>
      <h5>Dhanasekaran Witherspoon <small> Chief Food Officer</small></h5>
      <p class="pr-5 d-none d-sm-block">Our CFO, Danny, as he is affectionately referred to by his colleagues, comes
        from a long
        established family tradition in farming and produce. His experiences growing up on a farm in the Australian
        outback gave him great appreciation for varieties of food sources. As he puts it in his own words, Everything
        that runs, wins, and everything that stays, pays!.
      </p>
      <h5>Agumebe Tang <small> Chief Taste Officer</small></h5>
      <p class="pr-5 d-none d-sm-block">Blessed with the most discerning gustatory sense, Agumbe, our CFO, personally
        ensures that every
        dish that we serve meets his exacting tastes. Our chefs dread the tongue lashing that ensues if their dish does
        not meet his exacting standards. He lives by his motto, You click only if you survive my lick.
      </p>
      <h5>Alberto Somayya <small> Executive Chief</small></h5>
      <p class="pr-5 d-none d-sm-block">Award winning three-star Michelin chef with wide International experience having
        worked closely
        with whos-who in the culinary world, he specializes in creating mouthwatering Indo-Italian fusion experiences.
        He says, Put together the cuisines from the two craziest cultures, and you get a winning hit! Amma Mia!
